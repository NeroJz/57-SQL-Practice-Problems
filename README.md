# 57-SQL-Practice-Problems

<p>
As a software developer, our tasks often involve manipulating the data.
We often referred it as CRUD (creating, reading, updating and deleting) operations.<br/>
The most difficult operation is on the R (reading) part as the developer needs to generate reports based on
different preferences from the users.
The task becomes more overwhelming with the increase complexity of the relationship between tables. 
</p>

<p>
Many existing frameworks provide solution like (ORM or ActiveRecord) to simplify the development process.<br>
However, very often the developers need to write their own SQL statement in order to improve 
the performance of the backend side.<br/>
This includes using Stored Procedure, Stored Function as well as View.

provides practical exercises to improve the developer's SQL statement on the R part of CURD.<br/>
The solution of the book is written in MSSQL. However, this repository provides solutions for MYSQL.<br/>
It is important to highlight that the book is originally written for MSSQL, therefore, some functions like
FULL OUTER JOIN, Common Table Expression (CTE), ROW_NUMBER(), etc are not available on MYSQL.

<p>
The solutions in this repository is not the only answer.  You may have better or simple solutions.  
You can refer on the questions from the attached ebook to write the solutions in Oracle.<br/>
The most important thing is practice.
